**Summary**: This course surveys the leading computational frameworks for understanding human intelligence and cognition. Both psychologists and data scientists are working with increasingly large quantities of human behavioral data. Computational cognitive modeling aims to understand behavioral data and the mind and brain, more generally, by building computational models of the cognitive processes that produce the data. This course introduces the goals, philosophy, and technical concepts behind computational cognitive modeling.
 
The lectures cover artificial neural networks (deep learning), reinforcement learning, Bayesian modeling, model comparison and fitting, classification, probabilistic graphical models, and program induction. Modeling examples span a broad set of psychological abilities including learning, categorization, language, memory, decision making, and reasoning. The homework assignments include examining and implementing the models surveyed in class. Students will leave the course with a richer understanding of how computational modeling advances cognitive science, how cognitive science can inform research in machine learning and AI, and how to fit and evaluate cognitive models to understand behavioral data.

Please note that this syllabus is not final and there may be further adjustments.

## Pre-requisites
- Math: We will use concepts from linear algebra, calculus, and probability. If you had linear algebra and calculus as an undergrad, or if you have taken Math Tools in the psychology department, you will be in a good position for approaching the material. Familiarity with probability is also assumed. We will review some of the basic technical concepts in lab.

- Programming: Previous experience with Python is required. The assignments will use Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks (http://jupyter.org). We will have a Python refresher in lab, and we also recommend this tutorial (http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/).

## Grading
The final grade is based on the homeworks (60%) and the final project (40%).

Class participation will be used to decide grades in borderline cases. As we only meet once a week, class attendance is obviously important for success in the class.

## Final Project
<!-- The final project proposal is due TBD (one half page written). Please submit via email to instructors-ccm-spring2019@nyuccl.org with the file name lastname1-lastname2-lastname3-ccm-proposal.pdf. -->

<!-- The final project is due TBD. Please submit via email to instructors-ccm-spring2019@nyuccl.org with the file name lastname1-lastname2-lastname3-ccm-final.pdf. -->

The final project will be done in groups of 1-4 students. A short paper will be turned in describing the project (approximately 6 pages). The project will represent either an substantial extension of one of the homeworks (e.g., exploring some new aspect of one of the assignments), implementing and extending an existing cognitive modeling paper, or a cognitive modeling project related to your research.  We provide a list of project ideas [here](final_project_ideas.md), but of course you do not have to choose from this list.

Write-ups should be organized and written as a scientific paper. It must include the following sections: Introduction (with review of related work), Methods/Models, Results, and Discussion/Conclusion. A good example would be to follow the structure of this paper from the class readings:
- Peterson, J., Abbott, J., & Griffiths, T. (2016). Adapting Deep Network Features to Capture Psychological Representations. Presented at the 38th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society. [link here](http://cocosci.berkeley.edu/jpeterson/pdf/peterson-cogsci2016-adapting-deep.pdf)

Code submission is not required for the final project.

## Course policies

**Auditing**:  
Please email instructor to see if there are available seats. Priority goes to registered students and then by date of audit request.

**Collaboration and honor code**:  
We take the collaboration policy and [academic integrity](https://cas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/cas/academic-integrity.html) very seriously. Violations of the policy will result in zero points and possible disciplinary referral.

You may discuss the homework assignments with your classmates, but **you must run the simulations and complete the write-ups for the homeworks on your own.** Under no circumstance should students look at each other's code or write ups, or code/write-ups from previous years of this course. Do not share your write up or code with any of your classmates.

**Late work**:  
We will take off 10% for each day a homework or final project is late. Assignments should be turned in all-at-once and not in pieces. If an assignment is incomplete and later completed, the late penalty is applied to the entire assignment.

**Extra credit**:  
No extra credit will be given, out of interest of fairness.

**Laptops in class**:  
Laptops in class are strongly discouraged. We know many try to take notes on their laptops, but it’s easy to get distracted (social media, etc.). It also distracts everyone behind you if you are not engaged! We encourage you to engage with the class and material, and engage with us as the instructors. Ask questions! All slides are posted so there is no need to copy everything down, and paper notes are great too.

## Preconfigured cloud environment
Students registered for the course have the option of completing homework assignments on their personal computers, or in a cloud Jupyter environment with all required packages pre-installed. Students can log onto the environment using their nyu net ids [here](https://dsgs-3001005.rcnyu.org).
