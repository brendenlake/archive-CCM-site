    "In this assignment, we examine a Bayesian model of speech perception and implement an approximate inference algorithm. As discussed in lecture, a \"speaker\" produces a speech sound $T$ (e.g., a vowel sound) intended for a \"listener\". Because of noise during tranmission, the listener doesn't hear $T$ exactly; instead, he hears the corrupted physical stimulus $S$. \n",

    "The model postulates that the listener does a type of active reconstruction. Instead of verbatim perception of $S$, the listener aims to reconstruct the intended utterance $T$. Concretely, his/her perceptual system estimates $P(T|S)$, and this reconstructed stimulus is what they actually \"hear.\" Reconstructing the details of the intended production is a good idea for a listener, since these details can be important for understanding what was said due to co-articulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Bayesian model aims to explain the \"perceptual magnet effect\" in speech perception. This effect describes a particular kind of warping due to categorical representations. The phenomenon is that the perceived sound is closer to the category center than the raw stimulus $S$, in a way likened to a \"perceptual magnet.\" In Bayesian terms, we will model this as computing the reconstruction as the expected value of $P(T|S)$ (which is denoted $E[T|S]$).
