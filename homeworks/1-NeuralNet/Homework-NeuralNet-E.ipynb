    "In this notebook, you will train a recurrent neural network in PyTorch to learn an artificial grammar known as the \"Reber grammar\" (Reber, 1976). The Reber grammar is a classic learning task in psychology, and it is also a great domain for getting your hands dirty with recurrent neural networks.\n",

    "The goal of this assignment is to build intuition about the training and operation of recurrent neural networks. We will use a Simple Recurrent Network (SRN) as proposed in Elman (1990). Conceptually, SRNs are similar to the very popular LSTM and GRU networks in contemporary machine learning. We certainly could use more these complex types of recurrent networks instead, but we don't need the additional power here.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the Reber grammar that we will be attempting to master with the SRN. The Reber grammar defines a set of allowable or \"grammatical\" sequences. The SRN will learn a sequence prediction task: what is the next element/symbol in a sequence, given the past elements. If the SRN predictions are aligned with the grammar, we can say that the SRN has implicitly learned to behave like the grammar, although without explicitly learning rules!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reber grammar is diagrammed above as a finite state machine (FSM) with six nodes (states) indicated by \\#0,\\#1,...,\\#5. The FSM creates a string by traversing a path through the graph and visiting various nodes. It can transition between nodes that are connected by a directed edge, and when traversing an edge the FSM emits the output symbol associated with that edge. In the Reber grammar, each string begins with 'B' and ends with 'E'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over an example. Starting at 'Begin', let's trace a path through the following nodes, \\#0, \\#1, \\#3, and \\#5, now ending at 'End.' This would create the string 'BTXSE' (please confirm for yourself). Other paths are possible, and self-connections and loops allow the FSM to create an infinite set of strings. For example, we can retrace the same path as before, but following the self-connection at node \\#1, to create the path \\#0, \\#1, \\#1, \\#3, and \\#5. This creates the string 'BTSXSE.' Likewise, we could keep adding loops, creating 'BTSSXSE', 'BTSSSXSE', ...., 'BTSSSSSSSXSE' and so on. All of these strings are considered \"grammatical\" according to the Reber grammar. A string that cannot be produced by the grammar is called \"ungrammatical.\"\n",

    "The Reber grammar was carefully designed to display some interesting qualities to make it a difficult learning task. In general, the best a learner can do is predict one of two possible successors for a given node (except at the end of the sequence). For instance, if the grammar is at state \\#1, both 'S' and 'X' are valid next symbols.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",

This strategy does not uniquely identify the right set of possible next symbols. Instead, she must track the history further back, in order to make optimal predictions.\n",

They found that in the initial stages of learning, people's behavior was largely consistent with the first-order statistics, as computed by the first-order memory that you worked out in Problem 2. Thus, if the previous symbol was 'V', their behavior would be largely consistent with four possible successors (rather than just 2, if they had mastered the grammar), regardless of what had happened previously in the sequence.\n",
