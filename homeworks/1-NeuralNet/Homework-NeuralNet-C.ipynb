    "In this assignment, you will help implement and analyze a neural network model of semantic cognition. Semantic cognition is our intuitive understanding of objects and their properties. Semantic knowledge includes observations of which objects have which properties, and storage of these facts in long term memory. It also includes the ability to generalize, or predict which properties apply to which objects although they have not been directly observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores a neural network model of semantic cognition developed by Rogers and McClelland (R&M). R&M sought to model aspects of semantic cognition with a multi-layer neural network, which contrasts with classic symbolic approaches for organizing semantic knowledge. They model the cognitive development of semantic representation as gradient descent (the backpropgation algorithm), using a neural network trained to map objects to their corresponding properties. R&M also modeled the deterioration of semantic knowledge in dementia by adding noise to the learned representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network architecture is illustrated below.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/semcog_net.jpeg\" style=\"width: 450px;\"/>\n",
    "There are two input layers (\"Item Layer\" and \"Relation Layer\"), which pass through intermediate layers to produce an output pattern on the \"Attribute Layer.\" In this example, dark green is used to indicate active nodes (activation 1) and light green for inactive nodes (activation 0). The network is trained to answer queries involving an item (e.g., “Canary”) and a relation (e.g.,  “CAN”), outputting all attributes that are true of the item/relation pair (e.g., “grow, move, fly, sing”).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will set up the network architecture in PyTorch and train it. The dataset and code for training has been provided. You will then analyze how its semantic knowledge develops of the course of training. While the original model used logistic (sigmoid) activation functions for all of the intermediate and output layers, we will use the ReLu activation for the Representation and Hidden Layers, with a sigmoid activation for the Attribute Layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing this assignment requires knowledge of setting up a neural network architecture in PyTorch. Please review your notes from lab, and these three basic [PyTorch tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html), \"What is PyTorch?\", \"Autograd\", and \"Neural Networks\" which should have the basics you need.\n",
