    "**Summary:** We will examine whether deep convolutional neural networks (convnets) trained for image classification can predict human similarity ratings for handwritten digits. The images below are all clear examples of the digit '8'. Nonetheless, the left two '8's look more \"similar\" to me than the right two '8's. Can a neural network trained for classification help to explain judgments such as this one?\n",

We will then test the network's predictions by collecting similarity ratings from a couple of friends. *This assignment requires collecting a small amount of behavioral data, so grab a friend and don't wait to the last minute to get started!*\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to give you some hands-on experience with a powerful toolkit for computer vision (deep convnets), which has also recently been applied for studying human perception and categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2012, Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton trained a deep convnet (now called 'AlexNet') for object recognition and achieved very impressive results, reducing the number of errors on ImageNet by almost half compared to the next best approach. This paper ignited the recent deep learning revolution in computer vision, although convnets were being used for this purpose long before (LeCun et al. (1989) was the first to train deep convnets for digit recognition).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, the success of convnets has led researchers in cognitive science and neuroscience to explore their potential applications for understanding human visual perception and categorization. Here are some examples: Yamins et al. (2014) showed that deep convnets can predict neural response in high-level visual areas; Lake, Zaremba, Fergus, and Gureckis (2015) showed that deep convnets can explain human typicality ratings for some classes of natural images; Peterson, Abbott, and Griffiths (2016) explored convents for predicting similarity ratings between images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, like Peterson et al., we will explore convnets for predicting human similarity judgments between images. We use a relatively small-scale network trained for digit recognition, but the same principles can be used to study much more complex deep convnets trained for object recognition. Although \"similarity\" can be a tricky construct in cognitive science (Medin, Goldstone, & Gentner, 1993), similarity judgments are still a useful tool in a cognitive scientist's toolbox for understanding representation.\n",

Ask your participant to write their ratings next to each pair. Enter the ratings in the arrays `ratings_human_1_digit8` and `ratings_human_2_digit8` below. One participant can be yourself, but the other needs to be someone else.</li><br>\n",
